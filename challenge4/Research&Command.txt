From the research I conducted, I found this information. I used this website: https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/scale/

To scale up the "node-service" from one to three instance we have to use the Docker Compose command docker-compose up --scale node-service=3. 
This command increases the number of node-service containers running at the same time, 
which enhances the service's ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously. 
After executing the command, I verified the scaling by checking the output of docker-compose ps to ensure that the three instances are active.
A screenshot of this can be found in the screenshots folder.
