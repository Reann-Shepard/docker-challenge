## Project Title: Docker Final Assignment 

### Introduction

Welcome to the README.md file for the advanced segment of the Docker challenges repository. 
This segment was completed as a continuation of the Docker exploration in my Operating Systems (CPSY-300) course. 
Through these challenges, I deepened my understanding of Docker's capabilities in managing complex, multi-component applications and scaling services.

### About This Repository

This repository shows all the tasks I've accomplished for the advanced Docker Challenges which were part of the Docker final assignment. 
It includes Dockerfiles, docker-compose configurations, screenshots, and a detailed journal that documents each step of my learning process. 
Challenge 3 focuses on deploying a full-stack application, and Challenge 4 explores scaling a Node.js service.

### `student.cfg`

Contains my student details:

- Name: Zainul Malik
- Student ID: 000909370

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading! It provides an overview of the project, including an introduction, repository 
  contents, and a detailed report of my learning experience and findings.
- **student.cfg**: Stores my personal information.
- **challenge3/**: Contains all the materials related to deploying a full-stack application using Docker, involving a web server, Node.js application, and a database.
- **challenge4/**: Includes the resources for scaling up the Node.js application, demonstrating Docker's ability to manage increased load through service scaling.

## Learning Experience and Findings

Throughout this assignment, my skills in advanced Docker functionalities were significantly enhanced. Below are some of the key learning aspects:

- **Complex Application Management**: Gained and bettered my skills in configuring and managing multi-service Docker applications using docker-compose.
- **Service Scaling**: Learned how to scale services effectively and understood the impact of load distribution and redundancy on application performance.
- **Full-Stack Deployment**: Deployed a full-stack application integrating a web server, application server, and database, which taught me about the interconnected nature of modern web applications.
- **Debugging and Optimization**: Enhanced my troubleshooting skills by addressing issues related to service interdependencies and network configurations.

## Conclusion

This final Docker assignment provided me with a great and helpful insight into Docker's more sophisticated uses, such as coordinating and organizing complex applications and scaling services. 
Challenge 3 allowed me to apply full-stack deployment techniques, while Challenge 4 introduced me to the strategic aspects of scaling and load balancing. 
These challenges have not only solidified my understanding of Docker but also prepared me for future projects involving containerized environments. Overall, this hands-on experience has given me valuable knowledge about Docker and containerization which will be very useful for me in my future education and career.
